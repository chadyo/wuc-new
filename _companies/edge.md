## FOUNDERS

<p><strong>PAUL PUEY</strong>, CEO</p>
<p><a class="social-link" href="https://twitter.com/paullinator" target="_blank">Twitter</a> <a class="social-link" title="Paul Puey" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulpuey" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p><img src="/images/edge-paul-puey.png" alt="Paul Puey" style="float: right; margin-bottom: 20px;" />Paul is a proud Electrical Engineering and Computer Science graduate of UC Berkeley with a wide range of technical skills from low-level 3D graphics engineering to development of custom web CMS systems, even before people knew what a CMS was. He held lead engineering positions with Nvidia and Chromatic Research, but most recently owned and operated several non-technical small businesses throughout California. There he learned the importance of the intersection of people, business, and technology. Today, he aims to bring crypto mainstream with software and products aimed at simplifying crypto and making it insanely easy to send and secure these revolutionary assets while maintaining the highest level of privacy. When not converting people to crypto youâ€™ll likely find him climbing a rock in Joshua Tree or at a local climbing gym.</p>

Although he has a degree in Electrical Engineering from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, he is just as comfortable working with software as he is with electronics. He has built systems at every level of the technology stack, from custom circuit boards with embedded firmware up through web sites and 3D graphics applications. Through his work with Edge, William Swanson has become an official contributor to the libbitcoin project, where he has written and contributed several new functional modules. In April 2014 William teamed up with Amir Taaki, Pablo Martin of the Libbitcoin and DarkWallet project along with Damian Cutillo  in Toronto for the 2014 Bitcoin Expo Hackathon. The team won first place with the DarkMarket project, a proof of concept for one of the world's first fully decentralized, anonymous, peer to peer marketplaces.The hackathon prize money was donated to the Libbitcoin project's future development.</p>
